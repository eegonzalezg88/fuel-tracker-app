# Fuel Tracker App - Assets Placeholder

This folder contains placeholder information for app assets. When running the app, Expo will use default assets.

## Required Assets (Optional)

If you want to customize your app's appearance, you can add these files:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen (1242x2436px)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48px)

For now, Expo will use default assets, so the app will work without these files.

## How to Add Custom Assets

1. Create or download your custom images
2. Rename them according to the names above
3. Place them in this `assets/` folder
4. Restart the Expo development server

The app will automatically use your custom assets.
